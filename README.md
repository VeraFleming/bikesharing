## Overview of the analysis:

After a great trip to New York City where you used a bike sharing program to get to know the city and interact with the locals who use bikes to commute, a brilliant concept begins to shape in your head. Imagine launching a comparable bike-sharing program in your hometown. You decide that learning how New York City's bike-share system actually operates should be the first step. You will next develop a proposal for how it might operate in your city.
Your colleague suggests that you use City Bike data that has been released to the public for your analysis. But you have to be cautious when looking at the data, as it applies specifically to New York Cityâ€”Des Moines is quite different!
So, this is the analysis of City Bike data for month of August 2019.

## Results:

1. The overall number of bike rentals in NYC in August was 2 344 224, with subscribers renting bikes 1 900 359 times (or 81%) and non-subscribers renting bikes 433 865 times.

For our company idea, I would advise developing a flexible membership system that would encourage users to sign up for it and utilize it as it suits them.

2. A very popular tripduration time in NYC is 5 minutes.

This is indicates that people prefer to utilize bicycles for short distances, though for NYC this may be due to the city's highly urbanized. For our project, I advise considering the popular locations and the travel time between them.

3. Men are the ones who use bike sharing the most.

The highest number of rents is 108 087 times for men and 33 326 times for women. Which indicates that we should develop marketing techniques that specifically target more women.

4. The popular time for bike rentals usually during the weekdays from 7-9am and 5-7pm in NYC.

Probably a lot of people in NYC ride bicycles to and from work. We must thus determine its level of popularity in our city.

5. Gender breakdown for the most popular period to rent.

This image demonstrates that, despite the fact that men prefer to use bicycles more frequently than women, the popular time is the same for both sexes.

6. Breakdown between customers per weekdays.

On a weekday, subscribers prefer to hire bikes more frequently, which supports our theory about using bikes. Additionally, we can see that non-subscribers rent more frequently on weekends, signaling that it is probably a tourist area. We must therefore take care to locate stations in well-known tourist destinations and significant historical sites.

7. The most popular rental stations.

The busiest streets in the city and the most well-liked beginning points are shown in this image. Probably, in order to avoid traffic and possibly travel even more quickly, individuals prefer to use bicycles instead of automobiles. We need to examine a high traffick streets in our city to locate a stations.

## Summary:

After reviewing our analysis, it is clear that bike-sharing is highly common in NYC, but in order to operate in the same way in our city, more information and analysis of the locations where stations can be placed are required. Additionally, I would recommend modifying the current study to include street names and traffic data on the map in order to support our theory and perhaps even identify the most well-liked tourist attractions.
